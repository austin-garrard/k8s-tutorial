# k8s-tutorial

This is an introductory tutorial to Kubernetes. It contains a trimmed-down overview of what Kubernetes is and what problems it solves. There are a number of lessons which provide step-by-step instructions to take the provided code and run it in Kubernetes. You should be able to use these as examples when developing the Kubernetes configurations for your production applications. 

## Prerequisites

Generally, it is assumed you are working on a Mac with the latest docker-desktop installed. However, as long as the `docker` and `kubectl` commands work as documented on your machine, you should be able to follow along. 

- docker
- python
- kubernetes
  - for Mac, install docker-desktop and enable Kubernetes
  - otherwise, install minikube

## Instructions

Follow the numbered directories, each representing a lesson. Each lesson contains a readme with instructions and some source code to work with. Additionally, each lesson will contain exercises which are not discussed but have proved useful in my practical experience.
